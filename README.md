# WEEK-THREE-ASSIGNMENT
Design a relational database schema for a university management system. The schema should include the following entities:
Student (student ID, name, email, date of birth)
Course (course ID, title, description, credits)
Instructor (instructor ID, name, email, expertise)
Enrollment (enrollment ID, student ID, course ID, enrollment date)
## Implement the Schema:
Using SQL, implement the database schema you designed.
Ensure appropriate data types, constraints, and relationships (foreign keys) are defined for each table.
## Populate the Database:
Populate each table with sample data. Ensure that there are enough records to demonstrate the relationships between entities.
